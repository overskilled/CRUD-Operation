## TASK

Creat an interface for basic CRUD operations on a database


## DESCRIPTION

Here, my job was to create an interface so as to ease the basic create, read, update and delete operations in a database.

On this project, i created a database called "crudoperation" which you can reproduce with the [crudoperation.sql](https://github.com/overskilled/CRUD-Operation/blob/master/crudoperation.sql) by importing it using phpMyAdmin.

Then i created a table named "crud" to store all the data entered by my user in the form created in[user.php](https://github.com/overskilled/CRUD-Operation/blob/master/user.php)

Furthermore, i created a page to display all the users data in a table in [display.php](https://github.com/overskilled/CRUD-Operation/blob/master/display.php).

Finally, created the update form linked to the button in the table found in [display.php](https://github.com/overskilled/CRUD-Operation/blob/master/display.php), and delete fonctionality button.
